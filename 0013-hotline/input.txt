I like hotdogs.
nobody likes to work.
everybody smiles.
what do I do?
who smiles?
what do you do?
does Joe smile?
do I like to work?
everybody hurts sometimes.
who walks there?
Michal walks there.
who walks there?
what does Michal do?
do you understand?
nobody walks there.
do you understand now?
bye!
